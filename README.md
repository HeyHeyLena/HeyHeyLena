- 👋 Hi, I’m @HeyHeyLena
- 👀 I’m interested in digital history, digital humanities, information networks, web security, and learning to code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, but I'm open-minded.
- 📫 How to reach me: Github is fine for now. I'll share my email when I feel smarter.
